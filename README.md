# Similarweb Playlist

This is an exercise in my interview process for Similarweb. Fun

# Overview

This is a web app that allows people to create and listen to a shared youtube
playlist.

The front end of this app does most of the heavy lifting and the back end acts
as a "dumb pipe".

# TODO

- add front end logic
- connect front end to back end
- use youtube api
- use youtube embed api
- handle ports more gracefully
